                This is a personal website project that will act as a tracker/notes for 
                anything that I can track. There are a few things that I want this website
                to do.
            </h2>
			<ol>
                <li>
                    Be able to show (new to old chronologically) what I have 
                    seen in a categorized media type. This will include anime, movies, books
                </li>

                <li>
                    Incorporate a calendar that will act as a todo list. I want to be able to set
                    monthly and weekly goals. When I check all the items off of a todo list
                    I would like a picture of a cute anime girl jpg or gif to congratulate me
                </li>

                <li>
                    Make the landing page real pretty
                </li>
            </ol>
